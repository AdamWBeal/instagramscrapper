Time is running out for Ace! Happy boy needs a family to call his own!!! Ace, #A5139991, an 18 month old playful, energetic hunk of love is looking for a home with an active family. Former owners said he seems to be good with small children, gets along with small dogs, and is house trained. He is starting to learn basic obedience and would benefit from further training. After evaluation, we are recommending he be the only dog in the family. Ace is a volunteer favorite with his happy, sweet disposition❤️ Come meet this friendly, fun guy at: Castaic Shelter, 31044 N. Charlie Canyon Rd, Castaic, Ca 91384.

0,2018-02-13 08:27:28.394261,"These pictures show Millie in mid October about the time I adopted her, versus today. She’s come so far and is just about to her ideal weight of 7 lbs (she was just under 5 at adoption.) At first she wasn’t eating well and having digestive issues and so frail we were sure she wouldn’t be with us long💔. Today she eats like a 🐷 and no tummy issues, she’s very lively, playful and chases after me and likes to be chased, play bows and wrestles, and jumps up for attention. She joins in with the others barking at the door now too, puts the cats in their place, begs in the kitchen and is totally one of the pack. Thank you @truefaithfulpetrescuemission for seeing there was life left to live in this little old one and rescuing her, and allowing us to be her #fureverfamily! ❤️ #whatlovecando #seniorchihuahua #17yearsold #weightgain #healthyandhappy #adoptlove #rescue",False,28,2018-01-16T16:31:47.000Z,dreab825,https://www.instagram.com/p/BeBGO-DhaXF/?tagged=adoptlove,0

0,2018-02-13 08:29:23.404808,"When people meet my fur kids I am often asked if I picked them based on their color since they all three match. I was awakened by Piko's plaintive cries outside my apartment in Ishiyama, Japan back in 2000. A coworker in Maine in 2002 asked if I would take in a cat her brother found; of course I had to say ""yes"" when I saw Lucy was a tortie like Piko. I had no intention of adopting a dog when I met @corbinthekelpie @lexingtonhumane while leading some teen volunteers. He had just come down to the adoption floor and was timid and wouldn't come out of his kennel for the kids so I stayed after to work with him and then came early/stayed late following sessions until I couldn't bear the thought of him with anyone other than me. 😍 And here we are, one big happy family.

------------------
There must be some magic in Wizard’s one cloudy eye, because this enchanting sire casts a spell on every muggle he meets. Five year old Wizard is burbling with colorful personality, and is quite vocal about asking for attention. He’s currently not interested in being picked up, but will happily rub against you asking for pets (and offer magical purrs in return.) Hilarious Wizard is truly a must-meet kitty, who has been waiting at the shelter since November 2017 to be swooped into his forever home.
Make sure you ask to meet Wizard when you come in!

0,2018-02-13 08:32:04.285555,"Do you have a friend who is in the process of adopting? Did you know that Adoptive and Foster Parents tend to feel less Support than those who have biological children? So if you would buy your friend a gift whenever they give birth to a child, then give them one with each adoption too! Do you make freezer meals in preparation for the birth of a friends child? Then do it for your adoptive and foster mama friends too! Would you at least send a card to share your congratulations? Then guess what? Adoptive mamas want those too! I can’t encourage you enough! When we announced the adoption of our second child, we received two cards/gifts, two, it’s an unknown road to many. But I promise you’re gonna make your adoptive and foster friends CRY tears of absolute JOY!
