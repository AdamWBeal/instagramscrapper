0,2018-02-12 20:05:42.502794,"""I like the taste of hands"" - Gordie, Current bite quarantine resident ✋🏻 If a kitty at the shelter bites someone and draws blood, they have to be quarantined (basically kitty time out) for ten days as per county regulations. Essentially, it just allows us to make sure that they don't have rabies and haven't passed it to whoever they bit. Once their time out is over, they move back upstairs and are available for adoption again! Most of the cats who bite in the shelter are nice cats who are startled or scared in the moment. We don't have any problems finding them their purrfect new homes once they're available for adoption again!",False,344,2018-02-07T21:55:46.000Z,catadoptpdx,https://www.instagram.com/p/Be6UzG9HuW4/?tagged=adoptlove,0

8,2018-02-12 20:05:42.502794,"@acdgirl That's a good question! It's one of those old county laws that we have to follow. The county calls in the middle of and after the quarantine is over to check on the status of both the cat and the human involved. They actually just changed the rules in our county - it used to be that if a cat bit three times at the shelter and drew blood every time that we wouldn't be able to adopt them out. We had to transfer them out of the county to another shelter where the rules were different so they could find a home. Thankfully they changed the rule last year, so now there isn't a limit.",False,344,2018-02-07T21:55:46.000Z,catadoptpdx,https://www.instagram.com/p/Be6UzG9HuW4/?tagged=adoptlove,0
