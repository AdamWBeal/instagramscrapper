0,2018-02-12 20:39:07.256492,"My name is Bagheera, hear me meowwwww. Turn your speakers up! 🐱

This beautiful girl is available for adoption. She’s super gentle, she knows exactly where her claws are and she’s never scratched her foster parents. She does gentle pats to say ""hello human give me rubs!"" The only thing is that she doesn’t like being picked up. We've narrowed it down to she doesn’t like having her feet not on ground/on a surface. Dangling feet make her fussy and she jumps out of your arms but she does enjoy standing on top of your gut or on you. Hehehe.

She is one cool cat who would be a purrrrfect studio cat. Enjoys a good snooze while you're working and is independent. Does Bagheera sound like the right cat for you? Adopt her today!

0,2018-02-12 20:39:19.292141,"AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION!!!! Marea is a beautiful Terrier mix puppy born around 12/2/2017 who did not have a very nice start to her life. She and her brother were found on the side of the road in a box. Thankfully, a good samaritan found them and brought them to a local shelter. Now, Marea is loving life! She is such a happy, sweet, loving little girl. Her foster mom says her tail never stops wagging and she is always showering everyone with love licks! She is happy to play with her brother or any of her foster brothers and sisters. She will need a structural fenced in back yard to run and play in. Due to her age, she will need someone home more often than not and children in the home must be 5 years old or older. Marea has just started on her crate and house training and seems very treat motivated. If you are looking for a wonderful buddy for life, Marea is your girl. She currently weighs 7 pounds and may weight between 40 to 50 pounds when full grown. She is current with her vaccines, and her adoption fee will include her future spay, rabies, and microchip.
