She’s very mellow and likes to wander around a bit,…” using RepostRegramApp - Sally is a 10 year old #Chihuahua #Beagle mix. She’s very mellow and likes to wander around a bit, check out her surroundings, and then lie down for a while. Sally seems completely unfazed by the cats that she has seen here at the shelter, and they seem to feel the same about her! She has a cute waddle, but it’s sadly caused by stiffness in her hips. She is also in need of a dental and has flea dermatitis. This little lady just needs a quiet home to live out her golden years. She has been waiting at the shelter since Dec 29, 2017 & weighs 14 pounds.

This boy is quiet and reserved however will gladly soak up all the attention from his family once he knows he's home and safe forever. He would be the perfect only cat if you are looking for a solo kitty but could also share space willingly. His loyalty is unwavering and hopes yours will be too. Pounce loves the laser light and of course, any toys with bells or a bit of cat nip.

Meet Shawnee!
Shawnee has a sweet, soft face and a gentle personality to match! She enjoys going for walks with her person, walking elegantly by your side as you explore the neighborhood. As a German Shepherd dog, it's no surprise this girl is also a smarty who loves to work for.. treats! She knows Sit, 'Find it', and comes when called. Shawnee also likes to play fetch-- though her version is taken at a leisurely pace and she seems to enjoy relaxing and chewing the ball more
(**Scroll to see video!) 😉
.
Shawnee came into the shelter on Oct 21, 2017 as an Owner Surrender. No reason for surrender was given, but they did report that she is housebroken, is friendly with small dogs (though fought with her GSD sibling), and is okay in the car and on leash. Shawnee is 5 years old and 85 pounds.
This lovable, friendly girl is ready to join a family on a lifetime of adventures- come meet her today!

Taffy is a cheerful sweetheart who is as delightful as soft candy. She is treat-motivated and already knows “sit” and “shake”. She would make a good companion on long walks, hiking trips or just hanging out at home. When we had her in the yard, she wasn’t keen on meeting the other dogs so we think she would prefer a home where she can be top dog. If you’re looking for an outgoing girl who loves people, please consider our sweet Taffy or TAG, COMMENT & SHARE her story to help her find a home to call her own!

Taffy is a 3 years old, spayed white and tan Pit Bull Terrier Taffy who has been at the shelter since October 11, 2016.

She’s 11 years old and was brought to our shelter when her human mother passed away. Her late mama loved her very much, so her adoption fee has been taken care of.

Meet Shawnee!
Shawnee has a sweet, soft face and a gentle personality to match! She enjoys going for walks with her person, walking elegantly by your side as you explore the neighborhood. As a German Shepherd dog, it's no surprise this girl is also a smarty who loves to work for.. treats! She knows Sit, 'Find it', and comes when called. Shawnee also likes to play fetch-- though her version is taken at a leisurely pace and she seems to enjoy relaxing and chewing the ball more
(**Scroll to see video!) 😉
.
Shawnee came into the shelter on Oct 21, 2017 as an Owner Surrender. No reason for surrender was given, but they did report that she is housebroken, is friendly with small dogs (though fought with her GSD sibling), and is okay in the car and on leash. Shawnee is 5 years old and 85 pounds.
This lovable, friendly girl is ready to join a family on a lifetime of adventures- come meet her today!
💖 Shawnee #A1736835 🐾
