Smiley senior Yucon is a super sweet and affectionate gentleman. At 10 years of age, he has playful tendencies and bursts of energy that prove age is just a number! This happy meatball is 74 pounds but thinks he is a lap dog and likes to climb onto your lap for smooches if you give him the chance. 😙 He is calm and easygoing, already knows how to sit and walks well on leash. Talk about a silver fox! Yucon has been waiting at the shelter since December 2, 2017 and is so ready to find a home of his own. All of our dogs deserve a home with a soft warm bed to call their own, but this is especially true for seniors! Come in to meet dear Mr. Yucon today!
Yucon is *Blue/Medically Alerted for geriatric, worn teeth*. SHARE to help his special family find him!

Here's an update from his adopter; ""It's been just over 5 years since I adopted Kwame, and he has really grown into his role as my sidekick. In our two-cat family, he is the jester and the athlete. He loves his $20 window perch more than anything in the whole world, and he LIVES for da bird. He may not be big on other people, but I love that I am his person: that he asks to get under the blankets to snuggle on my lap, that he rests his chin on my arm while I work from home, and that his little face greets me every time I come home. He is the #1 kitty boy for me.""
