This independent, relaxed, sweet kitty is the ultimate lover girl once she feels comfortable in her space. She's fine with chillin' on her own but loves when company comes around for a visit! She currently resides in our lobby at our Sherwood location, along with the beautiful pink corsage decorating her face. Designed by Sweet Pickles Designs, these corsages come in lots of different colors as well as a handful of bowtie options as well! These cute and fabulous accessories are sold right in our Shelter! Pick one up for each of your cats or come say ""Hi"" to Gabrielle.

3,2018-02-12 19:32:20.381042,"@nankoehrsen One of the things that we do with our more carrier-fearing cats is to slowly build up their confidence in their carriers. We try to leave the carrier out and open all the time, so the kitty has access. Then we place treats inside the carrier, so the cat associates it with something good. Don't close the door immediately - give your cat some time before you actually have to transport them anywhere. Hopefully then they'll associate the carrier with good things instead of bad!",False,147,2018-02-09T23:40:10.000Z,catadoptpdx,https://www.instagram.com/p/Be_qVjZnZtQ/?tagged=adoptlove,0

A Chinese Sharpie/Siberian Husky mix, she's fancy and cuddly and smart, and also a little bit shy in the most endearing way. Our girl isn't afraid of commitment, either, and at 71 lbs. she's not too big, not too small, but just right! Wowee, what a dog!
Come meet this precious girl today! She has been waiting at the shelter since Nov 7, 2017. And please don‚Äôt forget to share!

Rosa needs a hero! This sweet 5 years old girl has been waiting at the shelter since Sept. 7, 2017 when her owner became ill and could no longer care for her. At the shelter the kennel has been Rosa‚Äôs safe place, where she would sit nicely for treats but was not quite ready to go for a walk. With some coaxing (and treats!), Rosa decided to join a volunteer friend for a walk. We finally got to see a happy girl enjoying just being a dog! This girl loves to play and chase squeaky toys! Grinning from ear to ear as she bounded around the yard with her ball and laid in the sunshine. üòÑ
Rosa needs an adopter who will go slow with her, to help her feel safe and to build her confidence. We‚Äôd like to see Rosa loved and enjoying the comforts of a home. Can you help Rosa out? Message us to come meet her! Please share!!

Vera has an easy mellow energy, and if you're looking for a couch companion to cuddle up with, Vera's the ideal candidate! She's eager to please and she was very attentive to her handler and followed her around the yard, right by her side. It's no mystery why she's a volunteer favorite at the shelter right now. She has quite a fan club, and any volunteers reading this, please check in with your comments below! Fall in love with Vera at 4800 Imhoff Place, Martinez, CA. We think she'd be a fabulous Valentine indeed!
