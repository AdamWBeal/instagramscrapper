Miss Bella is an ADORABLE girl who always has a happy grin on her face!
This 6 years young, 72 pounds roly poly loves to run and play with toys, and then cool down with a roll in the grass. Belly rubs anyone? She is affectionate and FRIENDLY, and a joy to be around. 💓 What more could you want? Come meet her TODAY and fall in love! Bella's already spayed so can go home the same day.
Bella was surrendered by her owner on Sept 11, 2017 when they lost their home. We hate when that happens but know that someone special is searching for a girl like Bella. They just need your help to find her, please SHARE! 💌

Rosa needs a hero! This sweet 5 years old girl has been waiting at the shelter since Sept. 7, 2017 when her owner became ill and could no longer care for her. At the shelter the kennel has been Rosa’s safe place, where she would sit nicely for treats but was not quite ready to go for a walk. With some coaxing (and treats!), Rosa decided to join a volunteer friend for a walk. We finally got to see a happy girl enjoying just being a dog! This girl loves to play and chase squeaky toys! Grinning from ear to ear as she bounded around the yard with her ball and laid in the sunshine. 😄
Rosa needs an adopter who will go slow with her, to help her feel safe and to build her confidence. We’d like to see Rosa loved and enjoying the comforts of a home. Can you help Rosa out? Message us to come meet her! Please share!!
