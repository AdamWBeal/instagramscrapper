I was given such a pretty name because while at first I may appear shy, once I get to know & trust- I really open up. 😉 Willing to play and show you my love, affection & beauty! Also my pink markings helped inspired my name—or so I was told. ;) I am super attentive to whomever’s on my team—and that’s what I’m looking for - good, friendly, loving teammates to call my own family. I don’t like to brag, but I learn quickly, know how to sit, and I can be a real amazing goofy loveball once I know you.

Rose is a sweet and lovely 4 years old, 58 pounds, brown brindle girl who has been waiting at the shelter for her special someone since Sept 25, 2017. Don't let this Sweetheart wait another day-- come meet her! Or help her to find her home by sharing!
