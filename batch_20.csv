Our wonderful boy TOM is currently in foster and still searching for a loving home to call his own. He is looking for a home that will make him feel extra special. He's been through so much when he first got here.

If you don't know his story, both Tom and his adopted sister Blanca came back to us after having a loving home for a wonderful six years. Unfortunately both their human parents passed away and that is why they came back with us. 💔It breaks our hearts that Tom not only lost his human parents, but also his adopted cat sister Blanca in such a short amount of time. Blanca went to join her human adopted parents a couple weeks after she came back. Since Blanca's passing, Tom hasn't been the same. Let's find this wonderful cat a home asap! He needs extra love at this time. 🐱❤️ TOM likes to be pet, enjoys attention, he's very curious and likes to play with toys. If you would like to ADOPT Tom please contact us for more information at info@CatLove.org (or direct message us) so we can schedule a meet and greet in Chino Hills, CA.

A Chinese Sharpie/Siberian Husky mix, she's fancy and cuddly and smart, and also a little bit shy in the most endearing way. Our girl isn't afraid of commitment, either, and at 71 lbs. she's not too big, not too small, but just right! Wowee, what a dog!
Come meet this precious girl today! She has been waiting at the shelter since Nov 7, 2017. And please don’t forget to share!

Love, patience, anxiety meds + a little daily “Pep Up” hemp 💚 from @honestkitchen has won this round. Looking forward to warmer weather and longer adventures outdoors. We have another big challenge ahead of us, but I’m optimistic that once it’s over and done the year will be great. #dogswithanxiety #dogmomswithanxiety #wearealotalike .
.
💚 the @honestkitchen hemp supplement is the only new addition to our daily regimen, so that speaks volumes about the effectiveness and the relief it has provided to Earl. Sadly not available for sale in Canada yet (thanks again, Health Canada!) but hopefully later this year it will be an option for other nervous, anxious and fearful dogs like Earl 💚.

Earl is wearing a toque from @lovebottherobot • check them out and spread the love! And as always, be kind. ❤️.

Kobi is a playful and energetic 90 pound boy who loves to work for treats! He already knows sit! He's also got a trick -- he knows how to jump to catch treats and then go right into a sit. How impressive! 😊 His previous owner said he was friendly with company and other dogs though he barks at cats. Model shelter tenant Kobi has also been evaluated and shortlisted by staff as a foster candidate! Ask about having Kobi as a houseguest! At the prime of his life at 7 years of age, Kobi has been looking for a new home since August 11, 2017 – an eternity for a lively guy like him. It's time for Kobi to know he is loved and appreciated. Come in to meet and adopt or foster Kobe today!
Kobi is listed as a #LabradorRetriever mix. He is *Blue/Medically Alerted for left eye corneal opacity*. Please SHARE to help Kobi get a second chance at a forever home!

Smiley senior Yucon is a super sweet and affectionate gentleman. At 10 years of age, he has playful tendencies and bursts of energy that prove age is just a number! This happy meatball is 74 pounds but thinks he is a lap dog and likes to climb onto your lap for smooches if you give him the chance. 😙 He is calm and easygoing, already knows how to sit and walks well on leash. Talk about a silver fox! Yucon has been waiting at the shelter since December 2, 2017 and is so ready to find a home of his own. All of our dogs deserve a home with a soft warm bed to call their own, but this is especially true for seniors! Come in to meet dear Mr. Yucon today!
Yucon is *Blue/Medically Alerted for geriatric, worn teeth*. SHARE to help his special family find him!
