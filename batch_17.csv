Rosa needs a hero! This sweet 5 years old girl has been waiting at the shelter since Sept. 7, 2017 when her owner became ill and could no longer care for her. At the shelter the kennel has been Rosa’s safe place, where she would sit nicely for treats but was not quite ready to go for a walk. With some coaxing (and treats!), Rosa decided to join a volunteer friend for a walk. We finally got to see a happy girl enjoying just being a dog! This girl loves to play and chase squeaky toys! Grinning from ear to ear as she bounded around the yard with her ball and laid in the sunshine. 😄
Rosa needs an adopter who will go slow with her, to help her feel safe and to build her confidence. We’d like to see Rosa loved and enjoying the comforts of a home. Can you help Rosa out? Message us to come meet her! Please share!!

His former family had this to say about him “Bodhi loves long hikes, going to the beach, running, playing catch-You should see how agile I am! I am also awesome on long drives, especially if you open the window and let the wind blow through my fur. I am such a happy boy and can do all kinds of tricks like shaking, high-fives, and jumping. I love having things to do.” Bodhi is about 40lbs, house broken, and just had his teeth cleaned. We recommend he is in adult only home due to a minor bite history.

Rosa needs a hero ASAP! This gentle 5 year old girl has been waiting at the shelter since Sept. 7, 2017 when her owner became ill, and could no longer care for her. Rosa is a sweet and obedient girl, will sit politely for treats. For while she was so scared at the shelter that she preferred not to leave her kennel, but she was recently talked into a walk by a volunteer friend (who sweetened the deal with treats.) Her human pals were thrilled to see Rosa enjoying just being a dog! This girl loves to play and chase squeaky toys! Grinning from ear to ear, she bounded around the yard with her ball and laid in the sunshine. 😄 Rosa has so many more years left of being a cheerful girl in her. She so deserves more of these sunny moments. The shelter is FULL and poor Rosa is at high risk of being euthanized. PLEASE help us get her out safely.
Rosa needs an adopter who will go slow with her, to help her feel safe and to build her confidence. We’d like to see Rosa loved and enjoying the comforts of a home. Can you show Rosa her story has a happy ending? Message us to come meet her!
