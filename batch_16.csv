0,2018-02-12 19:34:12.532343,"We are pleased to announce that we have a new program that partners with local and southern California TNR groups to help orphaned kittens by socializing them and finding loving homes. Big Red is one of those kittens. He is now 10 months old. He was turned into a local shelter and was going to be euthanized for being feral at only 4 months old. He is anything but. He loves kids, cats and gets along with dogs. His adoption fee is $75. He's neutered, chipped and vaccinated.

Rosa needs a hero! This sweet 5 years old girl has been waiting at the shelter since Sept. 7, 2017 when her owner became ill and could no longer care for her. At the shelter the kennel has been Rosa‚Äôs safe place, where she would sit nicely for treats but was not quite ready to go for a walk. With some coaxing (and treats!), Rosa decided to join a volunteer friend for a walk. We finally got to see a happy girl enjoying just being a dog! This girl loves to play and chase squeaky toys! Grinning from ear to ear as she bounded around the yard with her ball and laid in the sunshine. üòÑ
Rosa needs an adopter who will go slow with her, to help her feel safe and to build her confidence. We‚Äôd like to see Rosa loved and enjoying the comforts of a home. Can you help Rosa out? Message us to come meet her! Please share!!

Teddy is a bold little adventurer. He is the first to try new things whether it is learning to climb stairs or running through puddles. Boy, does he love a good puddle! His foster mom says he has two modes: play and sleep. He delights the kids in his foster home with his silly antics. He is always up for a game of tug or chase with his brother Tipper or one of the other dogs in the house. Teddy's mama is a Lab/Boxer mix which is where he got his beautiful brindle coat. His dad is a mystery, but it is obvious that he will be a big boy (Just look at that paw! But then, it IS the closest to the camera). Teddy was born in early December and he is vaccinated, neutered, micro-chipped, and ready for his forever family. Please contact forgottenpetadvocates@yahoo.com to meet him!

SWIPE ‚û°Ô∏è right to see two of my favorite tabby furriends for #featureafurriendfriday @pelusamelon.cats!! They are some of my best pals in the COI community and they're a cute bunch!! Pelusa is a very tiny cat, but she‚Äôs very adventurous and wild. She loves heights and spying on the neighbors.
Melon is a big lovable kitty. She always wants to cuddle and loves attention. She‚Äôs obsessed with food and doesn‚Äôt like being on a diet üòπ
Go give them some love and a follow! .

Rosa needs a hero! This sweet 5 years old girl has been waiting at the shelter since Sept. 7, 2017 when her owner became ill and could no longer care for her. At the shelter the kennel has been Rosa‚Äôs safe place, where she would sit nicely for treats but was not quite ready to go for a walk. With some coaxing (and treats!), Rosa decided to join a volunteer friend for a walk. We finally got to see a happy girl enjoying just being a dog! This girl loves to play and chase squeaky toys! Grinning from ear to ear as she bounded around the yard with her ball and laid in the sunshine. üòÑ
Rosa needs an adopter who will go slow with her, to help her feel safe and to build her confidence. We‚Äôd like to see Rosa loved and enjoying the comforts of a home. Can you help Rosa out? Message us to come meet her! Please share!!
