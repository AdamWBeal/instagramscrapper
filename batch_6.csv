0,2018-02-12 19:05:37.846054,"Hooray! These two special needs kitties, Pip & Squeak, have found forever homes! At a very young age, Squeak had to have both of his eyes removed, while Pip lost one. After the surgeries, Pip quickly learned how to be Squeak's eyes for her. She helped guide her to the litter box, helped her eat, and even play. She was her protector. They have been through a lot together, and it is so special to see them staying together in their loving, forever home. #iadopted

*rescuesneedyou 🚨Red Alert VERY URGENT- AT RISK! SHELTER IS FULL!!
Rosa needs a hero! This sweet 5 years old girl has been waiting at the shelter since Sept. 7, 2017 when her owner became ill and could no longer care for her. At the shelter the kennel has been Rosa’s safe place, where she would sit nicely for treats but was not quite ready to go for a walk. With some coaxing (and treats!), Rosa decided to join a volunteer friend for a walk. We finally got to see a happy girl enjoying just being a dog! This girl loves to play and chase squeaky toys! Grinning from ear to ear as she bounded around the yard with her ball and laid in the sunshine. 😄
Rosa needs an adopter who will go slow with her, to help her feel safe and to build her confidence. We’d like to see Rosa loved and enjoying the comforts of a home. Can you help Rosa out? Message us to come meet her! Please share!!

0,2018-02-12 19:06:29.052983,"Today, Ellie helped me make chocolate pancakes. She was so excited to have us eat them. She kept running around asking us, “Is your tummy SO FULL? Are you soooo happy?!?” and it kind of just hit me. My child knows what it means to be full and associates food with happy feelings. She knows nothing of real hunger and hopefully never will. Then there’s this other part where I’ve met SO many hungry kids throughout teaching and my mission trips. Then knowing that my future adopted children might have some sort of struggle with hunger as well, it sort of just blew me away. There’s no follow up to that thought either. I just soaked in the moment, feeling grateful that I’ve provided for at least one child, and feeling overwhelmed that I can’t yet do more for my other babe/s. In the meantime, Ellie and I can perfect our pancake recipe so we can serve them to any siblings that may come her way. #ellieardent #momlife #parenthood #adoption #fosterlove #adoptlove #adoptionrocks",False,44,2018-02-11T06:08:58.000Z,holykellbatman,https://www.instagram.com/p/BfC7oGmFwqh/?tagged=adoptlove,0
