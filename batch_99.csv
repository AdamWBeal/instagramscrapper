I WOULD love it if somebody would come who wanted to get to know me, and love me, and give me the forever home that I deserve. That is my dream...❤️🐶

Beautiful, sweet Lady has been waiting ONE YEAR (intake 01/03/17) for her special someone! Her ADOPTION FEE was recently SPONSORED by a generous donor who says “Her gentle spirit touched my soul. She wants to experience kindness.”
Lady was surrendered by her (previous) owners when she was pregnant. Her puppies have all been adopted and we would like to see her go home also! Lady has an irresistibly smiley face and takes treats like a perfect lady! She is very excitable in her kennel, but when you meet her, she shows her gentle & affectionate nature with people. She is 3 yrs old, 55 lbs., and spayed already. Come show her how good life with a person can be!

Beautiful, sweet Lady has been waiting ONE YEAR (intake 01/03/17) for her special someone! Her ADOPTION FEE was recently SPONSORED by a generous donor who says “Her gentle spirit touched my soul. She wants to experience kindness.”
.
Lady was surrendered by her (previous) owners when she was pregnant. Her puppies have all been adopted and we would like to see her go home also! Lady has an irresistibly smiley face and takes treats like a perfect lady! She is very excitable in her kennel, but when you meet her, she shows her gentle & affectionate nature with people. She is 3 yrs old, 55 lbs., and spayed already. Come show her how good life with a person can be!

Your pets can get frostbite and hypothermia; these temperatures can kill. Determining a safe amount of time outside can vary based on the individual dog, but puppies and small dogs, senior dogs, and dogs with thin coats should only be outside for short periods of time.
Please contact your local authorities if you see signs of animal abuse or cruelty. Animal neglect is a crime in all 50 states. In states like PA, owners can now face felony charges for leaving pets outside in freezing temperatures over a certain amount of time. If you see a pet left in the cold, please speak up. 💛

2,2018-02-13 09:42:45.038705,"I personally met with Lady and can attest to her sweet, gentle nature. A couple came in while I was meeting with Lady, looking for a dog who was “safe around their child but aggressive enough to be a watch dog”. They passed on Lady immediately. Their statement was uneducated and poorly worded (protective does not equal aggressive). Lady needs time to blossom, but that does not mean she won’t be protective. It’s my experience that dogs like Lady who need a little more patience to come out of their shell bond deeper with their people and that bond will include a protective nature. Here’s hoping Lady finds her forever home with someone who gets that we all need a little time decompressing to really blossom and get our groove back. ❤️ for Lady I will sponsor a “How Lady Got her Groove back” petco gift card spending spree for a new bed , toys and good nutrition 😌👌🏼😏",False,176,2018-01-03T17:18:36.000Z,northcentralshelter,https://www.instagram.com/p/BdftQiHh2Ox/?tagged=adoptlove,0

0,2018-02-13 09:44:01.922654,"#northcentralshelter - Happy New Year!! 🎊 This year's first happy tail adoption story comes from George who adopted Larry in December 2016, just in time for Larry to be home for the holidays! 🏠

George shares: “I grew up with dogs my whole life. My dad bred Dobermans and until about 6yrs ago we had a dog in the house. I had been wanting a new best friend for a while but always hesitated. My search began last year around June, but I didn’t find the perfect match until a friend sent me Larry's link. I came to meet him on a Saturday and spent about an hour outside his kennel before leaving without him. After sleeping on it, I rushed back Sunday morning and adopted him. Since then, a lot has happened. My father unexpectedly passed away in February 2017, I had to move in April 2017 and Larry had to get used to a small apartment! He’s been the best therapy this year. I take him everywhere I’m allowed- dog parks, restaurants, the beach, work! He is still pretty shy at first, but warms up to everyone pretty quickly. He has more toys than he knows what to do with and after hours of playing with them, he snores like an angry old man!” 😂

Thank you George for rescuing Larry, and we’re glad he could be a friend in your time of need also. What a great life he’s leading now! A happy reminder that all breeds can be found at your local shelter. Warm wishes for several more years of companionship and adventures! ❤️💚

0,2018-02-13 09:45:49.021827,Sweet Jubilee is a 12 year old diabetic kitty who is looking for her new family! Jubilee is a very relaxed lady who loves being snuggled and hanging out near humans. She takes insulin twice a day and is very tolerant of her shots. We think she'd do a-okay in a home with other kitties too! Come meet her at our Sherwood shelter today 😻,False,312,2018-01-02T23:56:57.000Z,catadoptpdx,https://www.instagram.com/p/Bdd2DRvn5Q9/?tagged=adoptlove,0
