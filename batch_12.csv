He already knows sit! He's also got a trick -- he knows how to jump to catch treats and then go right into a sit. How impressive! 😊 His previous owner said he was friendly with company and other dogs though he barks at cats. Model shelter tenant Kobi has also been evaluated and shortlisted by staff as a foster candidate! Ask about having Kobi as a houseguest! At the prime of his life at 7 years of age, Kobi has been looking for a new home since August 11, 2017 – an eternity for a lively guy like him. It's time for Kobi to know he is loved and appreciated. Come in to meet and adopt or foster Kobe today!
Kobi is listed as a #LabradorRetriever mix. He is *Blue/Medically Alerted for left eye corneal opacity*. Please SHARE to help Kobi get a second chance at a forever home!

A Chinese Sharpie/Siberian Husky mix, she's fancy and cuddly and smart, and also a little bit shy in the most endearing way. Our girl isn't afraid of commitment, either, and at 71 lbs. she's not too big, not too small, but just right! Wowee, what a dog!
Come meet this precious girl today! She has been waiting at the shelter since Nov 7, 2017. And please don’t forget to share!

#ROSA needs a hero! This sweet #5year old girl has been waiting at the shelter ➡️SINCE #Sept7, 2017 when her owner became ill and could no longer care for her. At the shelter the kennel has been Rosa’s safe place, where she would sit nicely for treats but was not quite ready to go for a walk. With some coaxing (and treats!), Rosa decided to join a volunteer friend for a walk. We finally got to see a happy girl enjoying just being a dog! This girl loves to play and chase squeaky toys! Grinning from ear to ear as she bounded around the yard with her ball and laid in the sunshine. 😄
Rosa needs an adopter who will go slow with her, to help her feel safe and to build her confidence. We’d like to see Rosa loved and enjoying the comforts of a home. Can you help Rosa out? Message us to come meet her! Please share!!
