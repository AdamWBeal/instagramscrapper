🐕 The better to hear a bag crinkling with my dear.
👩🏻 But what big feet you have. 🐕 The better to play fetch with you my dear.
👩🏻 And Raleigh, what a big head you have. 🐕 The better to display my adorable face for you my dear.
I swear, when he’s not looking like a deer, or Egyptian dog statue, or Scooby Doo, he looks like a human the way he stands on his hind legs. 😂💕

0,2018-02-12 19:08:55.878720,"Hi, my name is Tucks! I’m an 8 year old guy that was surrendered to Burl. County Shelter for owner health. I’m a bigger guy that enjoys the finer things in life - treats, wet food, bird watching, snuggling in my bed.
I was rescued by The Cats Meow Rescue on December 29, 2017 because I wasn’t getting any interest at the shelter. They knew I needed a dental and wanted to make sure I got it before getting a home so I could live a happy, pain free life. Unfortunately my dental has been postponed because a few weeks after they rescued me, I began to limp. Yes, my breath is still bad, my gums are still bad, and my teeth are still bad but don't worry I'm still getting great vet care and meds. As if all that and being surrendered wasn't bad enough now I have another big issue that I need help with! Back to the vet I went. No tongue depressor this time but they did take a weird picture of me. Well, actually it was a picture of the inside of me (an x-ray). They say I have a mass but I need to see a specialist to determine exactly what that means. I may even need different kinds of weird pictures... an untrasound or better yet a CAT scan (get it!?! Hehe). Anyway, my volunteer friends said if I write this and include really cute pictures of myself, I might get the donations I need to pay for my specialist visit and potential treatment so that I can then get well enough to get these awful teeth taken care of.
To donate to my diagnostic care, potential treatment and dental surgery, please use this website or use PayPal link at www.CatsMeowNJ.org. All donations are tax deductible. Thanks for reading and supporting me in my time of need!
Rough estimate of my care:
To present- three visits to Willingboro Vet with medications $310.42
Future- Surgeon consultation $150
CT Scan for diagnosis of mass $1,500-$2,000

Dental surgery $500-$900

She also LOVES to play! She is currently in foster and gets along great with other cats. Petunia needs a fun, loving home that she gets lots of attention. She’d do well in a loud or quiet home, with or without kids. Ask us about Petunia, she got spayed this week!

The Cat’s Meow took him into a foster home with two other kittens and he has done great! Marco can be shy when meeting new people or being in new situations, but he’s a big time snuggler once he knows you! He likes to be held like a baby and put his face into your neck purring at the top of his lungs! He needs a quiet home, without kids, to help him adjust and become the brave kitty we know he can be! Ask us about Marco, he was neutered this week!
