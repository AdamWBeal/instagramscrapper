0,2018-02-12 20:43:53.295680,"AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION!!! Meet Pumpkin a very handsome 2 year old English Bulldog/Terrier mix. Pumpkin is a total love bug and just wants to be by your side; he really thinks he is a lap dog. His foster family says his favorite thing to do is just be with you, or run around in the backyard. He is a happy pup; very friendly and great with people. Pumpkin has been waiting patiently for a new forever family to find him and give his all the attention and love he deserves. He was found by a Good Samaritan on the side of the road left abandoned and neglected. Pumpkin is such a great boy and a true survivor. He is ready to start his second chance at life. He is very treat motivated and a good listener. He is house trained, and learning basic commands. He does well with the cats. Pumpkin weighs around 50 lbs. He is up to date on vaccines, neutered and microchipped. If you’re looking for a companion or a buddy, send an email to adopt@carolinapaws.com and ask about Pumpkin. #Carolinapaws, #dog, #dogs, #adopt, #adoption, #rescue, #petfinder, #dogsofinstagram, #sweet, #charlotte, #lovedogs, #rescuedog, #cute, #rescuesrock, #rescuedogsofinstagram, #adorable, #secondchance, #northcarolina, #adoptlove, #loverescues, #saved #Waxhaw #clt #charlottenc #adoptdontshop #704",False,94,2018-02-06T01:37:37.000Z,carolinapawsnc,https://www.instagram.com/p/Be1kmQbFxQ-/?tagged=adoptlove,0
