So my friend took me for a ride in his mobile play room. I got to hang out, and relax, and bark at stuff as it passed by.
And I got good news about my leg. The vet said the x-ray showed it is healing nicely. I don’t even have to go back! And I can return to normal activity??! My friends had to ask what that meant. Three 30-minute walks a day was the answer. Well LOL, that isn’t normal Confetti activity. It’s still going to be some months until Confetti can be Confetti again...#ttarecovery #adoptme #adoptlove #boxerpitmix #adoptconfettialready #shelterdogneedsagoodhome #rbarishelter",False,55,2018-01-05T20:45:38.000Z,adoptconfetti,https://www.instagram.com/p/BdlOipkhLaL/?tagged=adoptlove,0

We went trudging through snow on leash too at 4 months post op. Just know where your icy spots are. Off leash she would be bounding like a gazelle!

Beautiful, sweet Lady has been waiting ONE YEAR (intake 01/03/17) for her special someone! Her ADOPTION FEE was recently SPONSORED by a generous donor who says “Her gentle spirit touched my soul. She wants to experience kindness.”
.
Lady was surrendered by her (previous) owners when she was pregnant. Her puppies have all been adopted and we would like to see her go home also! Lady has an irresistibly smiley face and takes treats like a perfect lady! She is very excitable in her kennel, but when you meet her, she shows her gentle & affectionate nature with people. She is 3 yrs old, 55 lbs., and spayed already. Come show her how good life with a person can be!

Meet shy boy Gunner. #A5139347 Gunner is 3 year old pitbull. What he lacks in confidence he makes up for in sweetness. Gunner needs an adopter who will be patient with him and show him he is safe. We don’t know what kind of adventures he had but we are sure it was super scary out there by himself. He is very shy at first but when he gets to know you he comes out of his shell and his tail will start to wag. Gunner knows his basic commands and is great on a leash. Gunner also lights up when he sees other dogs, so we believe he would be a good addition in a home with other pets. Gunner is a very sweet boy who just needs a little time and love invested into him.
Available for adoption at the Castaic Shelter. 31044 N. Charlie Canyon Rd. Castaic, Ca. 91384. 661-257-3191 Hours: Mon-Thurs 12-7 and Fri-Sun 10-5. Closed Holidays.

Beautiful, sweet Lady has been waiting ONE YEAR (intake 01/03/17) for her special someone! Her ADOPTION FEE was recently SPONSORED by a generous donor who says “Her gentle spirit touched my soul. She wants to experience kindness.”
Lady was surrendered by her (previous) owners when she was pregnant. Her puppies have all been adopted and we would like to see her go home also! Lady has an irresistibly smiley face and takes treats like a perfect lady! She is very excitable in her kennel, but when you meet her, she shows her gentle & affectionate nature with people. She is 3 yrs old, 55 lbs., and spayed already. Come show her how good life with a person can be!

Beautiful, sweet Lady has been waiting ONE YEAR (intake 01/03/17) for her special someone! Her ADOPTION FEE was recently SPONSORED by a generous donor who says “Her gentle spirit touched my soul. She wants to experience kindness.”
Lady was surrendered by her (previous) owners when she was pregnant. Her puppies have all been adopted and we would like to see her go home also! Lady has an irresistibly smiley face and takes treats like a perfect lady! She is very excitable in her kennel, but when you meet her, she shows her gentle & affectionate nature with people. She is 3 yrs old, 55 lbs., and spayed already. Come show her how good life with a person can be!

Isabel is a snuggly lil' pocket pittie who charms everyone she meets with her irresistible smile! This affectionate girl is just 45 lbs., and has an undeniable joie de vivre about her, and she doesn't let the fact that she has some arthritis in her legs stop her from chasing the ball and telling people she wants to play! Isabel is truly a lover of a pup who is friendly with everyone she encounters!
Despite Isabel’s HAPPY & loving personality, she came into the shelter in very sad shape in early August. She was overbred, abandoned, and had a skin infection over most of her body. With TLC, she is recovering very well and ready to find a family who will cherish her!! This nugget of sunshine belongs in a home! Please help us to spread the word about this sweet girl - you could be the hero Isabel needs!

Beautiful, sweet Lady has been waiting ONE YEAR (intake 01/03/17) for her special someone! Her ADOPTION FEE was recently SPONSORED by a generous donor who says “Her gentle spirit touched my soul. She wants to experience kindness.”
Lady was surrendered by her (previous) owners when she was pregnant. Her puppies have all been adopted and we would like to see her go home also! Lady has an irresistibly smiley face and takes treats like a perfect lady! She is very excitable in her kennel, but when you meet her, she shows her gentle & affectionate nature with people. She is 3 yrs old, 55 lbs., and spayed already. Come show her how good life with a person can be!
🌷LADY #A1674966 ❤️
